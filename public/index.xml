      <title>Information Coefficients and Linear Regression</title>

      <description>Motivation In this paper we use Monte Carlo simulation to show the relationship between the Information Coefficient (IC), correlation, decile returns, and linear regression.1 We can also gain insight into investment related questions, such as
 What level of IC is considered good? What effect does volatility have on the spread? What effect does universe size have on the hit rate?  We will start off by defining some terms so we are all on the same page.</description>

      <title>R Shiny / Rstudio Server on CentOS Install Notes</title>

      <description>Today I upgraded to Shiny 1.3.0 and my Shiny server stopped rendering my apps correctly. Rstudio&amp;rsquo;s @winston and @jcheng came to my rescue and determined that it was a problem with my nginx proxy settings. That prompted me to write up these notes so next time I have to set up a server, I won&amp;rsquo;t be starting from scratch.
Install and configure Nginx Here is the Rstudio article. Here is my corrected nginx.</description>

      <title>Linux Notes</title>

      <description>I am a big fan of Linux. I enjoy ssh-ing into servers and using the command line, but since I don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily use Linux every day, I sometimes forget some of the commands, so I keep this reference for myself.
Linux commands and other command line tools Users and Groups  useradd myname add a new user with the name myname. userdel ubuntu delete the username ubuntu. For example, after creating your own username, you may want to remove the default ubuntu username to make the server more secure.</description>

      <description>I have been using Google Voice since it started as Grand Central, before Google bought it. Google Voice became even better when Obihai came out with an analog telephone adapter (ATA) that would connect directly to it. To be able to make free calls to relatives, I installed an Obi110 device at their house as well. Learning VoIP has been a long and confusing journey, but it has also been a good learning experience.</description>

      <title>SQLAlchemy ORM versus Raw SQL</title>

      <description>Python: SQLAlchemy ORM versus Raw SQL I was reading this blog post [https://auth0.com/blog/sqlalchemy-orm-tutorial-for-python-developers/] about SQLAlchemy and how to run queries using its Object Relational Mapper (ORM). It is a very good intruduction to the pythonic ORM way of talking to databases, but I think I still prefer using raw SQL. In this post I will show you some reasons why I prefer raw SQL. I will use the same database and tables used in the original tutorial for these examples.</description>

      <description>Prerequisites Before we get to the optimization examples, we will download the price history for a small number of ETFs and show how to calculate the returns, standard deviations, variance matrix and other inputs that we will need for the optimizer.
Prices For these examples, we will download the daily prices for a handful of ETFs from Yahoo Finance, starting in 2003. Once the daily data is downloaded, we use the to.</description>

      <description>This is a collection of some of my adventures (and misadventures) in home ownership and repair. This page will also act as an instruction manual should I ever try to sell my house. I would always recommend someone hire a professional if they feel uncomfortable doing a repair on their house. I do many of these repairs myself because it affords me an opportunity to learn more about how all these systems work and, often times, make improvements that otherwise probably would not happen.</description>
