I am a quant finance professional working in NYC.  I have spent my entire career working in the equity markets.  My main programming languages are R and SQL.  

I have a deep love of learning and enjoy figuring out how things work, be it the stock market, plumbing systems, electrical systems, or cars.  I enjoy using my Raspberry Pi for home automation projects.

You can reach me at roger dot bos at gmail dot com.

This entire website was built in R using the [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package.  As a volunteer, I have built websites for other organizations, such as social entertainer [Lamboginny](https://www.lamboginny.org) and Sea Scouts BSA [Ship 84](https://www.ship84.com).
