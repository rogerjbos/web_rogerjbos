I am a quant finance professional working in NYC.  I have spent my entire career working in the equity markets.  My main programming languages are R and SQL, with over 17 years of experience.  I also know Python, Bash, and VBA.  The first two programming languages I learned were C++ and Java, but I haven't used them in a long time.  I am currently learning Go, Haskell, and Typescript and [Exercism](https://exercism.org/).

I have a deep love of learning and enjoy figuring out how things work, be it the stock market, plumbing systems, electrical systems, or cars.  I enjoy using my Raspberry Pi for home automation projects.

This entire website was built in R using the [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package.  On a volunteer basis, I have built websites for other organizations, such as social entertainer [Lamboginny](https://www.lamboginny.org) and Sea Scouts BSA [Ship 84](https://www.ship84.com), which are all graciously hosted by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
